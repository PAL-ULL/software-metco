How to execute:
java -jar experiment-validator.jar <files ...> and/or <folders ...>

The application can receive files and/or folders. In case of folders, all .xml files on the folder are processed.
To compare floating point values the application only takes into account 14 decimal places. This default value can be changed through the property mornd.decimal.places. For example:

java -Dmornd.decimal.places=10 -jar experiment-validator.jar <files ...> and/or <folders ...>
